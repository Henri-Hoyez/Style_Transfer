### Style_Transfer


# Style Transfert Principe

The principle of the style transfer is the following one:
  - We take 3 images : the style image, the content image and the input image
  - According to the weight we will attribute to the style or content we will have a different result
  
The input image is the combination of the style image and the content image
According to the weight we will attribute to the style or content image, we will have a different result.
